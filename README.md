Hi!

Once upon a time I spent a year bicycling around the country. It was a 
very wonderful experience, but I wished every day for a better route 
planning tool. So, here it is! Or here it will be eventually. 

###Coming soon
* Elevation data caching
* Authentication (I've testing out the meteor auth branch - it's pretty slick)
* Next location search box
* Proper tutorial


### NSFAQ

* Why are you using meteor?
 * Well, I actually started this project as a rails app, it's here on 
github and everything. When I started playing with meteor I just thought, 
hey maybe I'll see how far I can get on a reimplementation of my 
touring app. After a few short hours I had rebuilt the whole damn thing. 
With the obvious glaring exception of authentication that is. I was 
blown away at how powerful meteor is and how pleasant the development 
experience could be. Even if I do decide to go back to a more stable 
framework for the final version, I will benefit immensely from this meteor 
brain storming session.
